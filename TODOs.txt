(on hold)
UI minor issue:
The distances between the title, subtitle and buttons should have a logic, a hierarchy and a consistency across all the pages. Also the distances should not be too large (they are too large now). (ongoing)

(on hold)
For every page, The Font for the subtitle should be larger (almost same as the page title). The subtitle should be in a dark grey font color. there should be an empty line between the subtitle and the next elements (buttons)

(on hold, didnt work -  breaks app)
The UI of the main page should have an organization as some boxes vertically arranged, to organize the elements. on top there is the title, then the subtitle, then the control buttons (load prompts, etc..) and then the rest of the buttons (categories). in each box, the elements should be arranged dinamically (can change from vertical to grid , to horizontal, depending on the screen)

(on hold, didnt work -  breaks app) ; UI consistency:
The UI of every page (main page, categories pages, new category, new prompt, etc) should have an consistent organization as some boxes vertically arranged, to organize the elements. on top there is the title, then the subtitle, then the control buttons (load prompts, back or whatever) and then the rest of the buttons (categories, prompts, ..). in each box, the elements should be arranged dinamically (can change from vertical to grid , to horizontal, depending on the screen)

(on hold)
While scrolling down, The page title, subtitle and grey buttons, should stay fix and only the items buttons should scroll (the buttons indicating the categories in the case of the main page and the buttons for the prompts in the other specific categories pages)

(done)
UI bug: 
In the screen for New Category, the subtitle "New Category" is appearing twice. one on top (that should stay) and one below (that should be removed)

(done)
UX minor issue:
In the screen for adding a new prompt, there should be a back button, similar as in the specific categories pages, for the case that the user decides to not add a new prompt

UX minor issue:
In the screen for adding a new category, there should be a back button, similar as in the specific categories pages, for the case that the user decides to not add a new category

UX and functional improvement:
There should be for each category that has no prompts (empty) the option to delete the category. There will be a small button on the right part of each category button for delete . this button will only be enabled if the category is empty.

UX and functional improvement:
There should be for each prompt item and button the options to delete and to edit the prompt. There will be 2 small buttons on the right part of each prompts button for delete and edit. If the user clicks the delete button, a pop up message will appear that ask the user to confirm delete or cancel (keep). If the user clicks the edit button, then a page looking same as the page for creating a new prompt will appear (same fields and buttons). In this page, the user can edit the prompt or any of the prompt item fields and save it or go back (without saving). Make sure that after saving the old prompt is removed and only the new one is available.

UI minor issue:
when creating a new category, the value in the text field from the last category is still there. it should be reseted.
