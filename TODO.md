# UI/UX Feedback and Improvements

## Default Prompt File
There should be a default prompt file loaded automatically by the app. This file is the `data.json` file, found in the same directory as the `index.html` file. The app will load that file per default but still has all the other options unchanged for loading, saving files from local and also the reset option.

## Fixed Elements (Optional)
When scrolling down, the page title, subtitle, and grey buttons should stay fixed, while only the items buttons should scroll. This includes the buttons indicating the categories on the main page, as well as the buttons for the prompts on the specific category pages.

## UI Issues (Optional)
### Text Field Persistence
When creating a new category, the value in the text field from the last category remains. This value should be reset to ensure a consistent user experience.

## UX Suggestions (Optional)
### Button Placement
The buttons "Load Prompts File," "Save Prompts File," and "+Add New Category" could be placed in a less prominent location, especially since a default prompts file is loaded automatically. 

If the default loading feature works effectively, the "Load Prompt File" and "Save Prompt File" buttons could be made less prominent and renamed to "Load Local File" and "Save as Local File."

### Placement of "+Add New Category"
The "+Add New Category" button could be separated from the other two buttons. A possible suggestion is to place it on the same line container as the subtitle "Categories," but aligned to the far right.
